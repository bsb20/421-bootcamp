# SQL Workout

The empty files in this directory are to be filled in with SQL.
When you are happy with a file, you can check you answer using

`./check.py FILE_OR_TEST_NAME`

For example

`./check.py q1_sample.sql`

or

`./check.py q1_sample`

The questions for each file are below.  **No peeking at the solutions**  :eyes:.
